# 🏏 IPL Data Analysis

## 📖 Project Overview  
The aim of this project is to perform an end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Indian Premier League (IPL) match data from 2008 to 2020. Using Python, we’ll uncover insights on teams, players, match conditions, and trends over time.

## 📂 Dataset  
The analysis uses two CSV files:
1. **matches.csv** – Ball-by-ball match summary for each season (2008–2020).  
2. **deliveries.csv** – Detailed delivery-level data (runs, wickets, extras, fielding events, etc.).

- **Fielding & Extras**  
  - Who takes the most catches?  
  - Who effects the most run-outs?  
  - Compare total wickets from catches versus run-outs.  

- **Toss & Match Outcomes**  
  - Count toss wins by each team.  
  - Analyze match winners after winning the toss.  
  - Determine whether tossing advantages translate to more match wins.  

- **Team & Scoring Trends**  
  - Identify the most successful teams overall.  
  - Track the highest number of sixes and fours by player and by team.  
  - Examine “toss decision” trends overall and team-wise.
